This Wordpress plugin is a simple solution to catch 'em all, those xAPI statements that have been sent by H5P content types. It allows you to store (the most relevant) xAPI properties in the database of WordPress. It also allows you to view, filter and export these data as a CSV file for further processing.

== Description ==

This Wordpress plugin is a simple solution to catch 'em all, those xAPI statements that have been sent by H5P (https://h5p.org) content types. It allows you to store (the most relevant) xAPI properties in the database of WordPress. It also allows you to view, filter and export these data as a CSV file for further processing.

Please cmp. https://www.olivertacke.de/labs/2017/12/27/gotta-catch-em-all/ and https://www.olivertacke.de/labs/2018/03/25/collecting-and-analyzing-data-with-h5p-and-opening-up-education-maybe/ for the ideas behind the plugin.

This plugin is NOT intended to work as a replacement for a decent Learning Record Store. It will work well for smaller platforms, but if you are expecting to track many xAPI statements, you will probably run into trouble with displaying all the data at some point.

This plugin is NOT intended to forward xAPI statements sent by H5P to a Learning Record Store. Please use https://github.com/tunapanda/wp-h5p-xapi if you need that functionality.

This plugin is NOT intended to replace the H5P plugin's reporting or provide functionality for analysis, etc. There is no point in recreating what is already available in Learning Record Stores or what you can do yourself with a spreadsheet software, scikit-learn, etc.

If you need more, you should give Learning Locker (https://learninglocker.net/) a shot. It's open, free and shiny.

PLEASE NOTE: H5P IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF JOUBEL. THIS PLUGIN WAS NEITHER CREATED BY JOUBEL NOR IS IT ENDORSED BY THEM.

== GDPR ==
Please note that as of May 25, 2018 you may have to comply with the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR, http://gdpr-info.eu/).

H5PxAPIkatchu supports the functions that WordPress offers to

- use suggestion for your privacy statement text,
- export personal data of a user, and
- delete personal data of a user.

Background: If you're using H5PxAPIkachu, by processing the xAPI statements you're processing at least these personal data items according to art. 4 GDPR:

- xAPI statement: Actor/name (Full name of the Agent)
- xAPI statement:Actor/Inverse Functional Identifier (email address, openID or account data within the host system)
- WordPress user id (ID given by the WordPress host system)

Please make sure to account for these items in your GDPR processes and documentation.

== Installation ==

Install H5PxAPIkatchu from the Wordpress Plugin directory or via your Wordpress instance and activate it. Done.

The most important parts of the xAPI statements that are emitted by H5P content types on your system should now be stored in your database. You can view and download them via the new WordPress menu item.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin does not record anything! Is it broken? =
Maybe, but hopefully not.

1. The plugin does NOT record xAPI statements if you are using H5P content in the backend of WordPress. That would mess up your statistics, because all the authors' test runs would be recorded, too. So, are you running H5P within a blog post or within a page?
2. The plugin does NOT record xAPI statements if you are the author of that content and logged in. That would mess up your statistics as well.
3. The plugin doesn't record xAPI statements if you told it so in the options :-)

== Screenshots ==

1. You can change some options to your particular needs.
2. You cannot only view the stored data, but also download them as an CSV file.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.4.14 =
Upgrade at will.

= 0.4.13 =
Upgrade if you need Dutch translations.

= 0.4.12 =
Upgrade if you do not want to store all statements from all contents but only from a few selected contents.

= 0.4.11 =
Upgrade if you're running PHP 8.0 or above.

= 0.4.10 =
Upgrade if you experience problems with the configuration file.

Upgrade if you want to register xAPI statements from your content that is embedded on other pages.
Please note that you need to activate this option first. Activating this option may lead to unexpected xAPI statements (in high numbers) if others embed your content somewhere. Your server will have to cope with all these statements. This behavior may deplete your resources and is a potential gateway for a denial-of-service attack.

Upgrade if you have WP debugging activated.
